                <p className='p-4 text-2xl leading-relaxed sm:leading-loose text-gray-800'>Z’Mariks (zee-mare-icks) name is the main ingredient for the originality in our restaurant. Drawing from the legacy of Ellie’s Greek roots, 
                Z’Mariks is derived from the Greek word for pasta: Zimarika. This unique name, the assortment of culturally influenced items, and heirloom Greek recipes is what sets 
                Z’Mariks apart from other fast-casual noodle joints. Come in to one of our locations and see for yourself how Z’Mariks Noodle Café celebrates fresh food, affordable
